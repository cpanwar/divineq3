Bookings API
Author: Carson Lam

Description
This API allows for the booking/reservation of resources, with time conflict-checking.
Suitable for applications that have a focus on times, such as room bookings, hotel reservations,
rentals, or public library computer bookings.
It will create tables in your database to store booking information.
It does nothing on its own; you will need to write code to utilise it.

Prerequisites
- Date API
- Date Repeat
- Views

ALPHA RELEASE NOTES
===================
So far, this module has only been very lightly tested, and is prone to significant changes.

See http://drupal.org/project/publicbookings/ for the implementation that is being developed
concurrently.

This module assumes you are using MySQL 5 with MyISAM.
All DATETIME columns generated by the schema should preferably be TIMESTAMPs instead,
to take advantage of its timezone properties. It's also smaller than DATETIME.
Certain columns should also be ENUM, but hook_schema also doesn't support this.
I work with TIMESTAMPs, ENUMs, and other tweaks not yet present in the install schema.
This API should work regardless, but I haven't tested it yet.

The following Date API patches are required:
- http://drupal.org/node/273669#comment-910543
They involve this module's handling and use of iCal RRULEs and EXDATEs. Attempts to
create or update any bookings or availabilities without these patches will probably fail.

What I know is not working:
- Recognition of contiguous availability timeframes. For a resource where the default
  availability is rigid unavailable, bookings are wrongly deemed invalid if they aren't
  entirely within one availability record.
- RRULEs with no UNTIL.

What I think is working:
- Conflict checking for single and recurring timeframes. Specifically, bookings and
  unavailabilities that conflict with specified timeframe(s) are detected.
- CRUD operations for resources, bookings/availabilities, and instances.
