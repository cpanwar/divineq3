The Smartqueue per-User (smartqueue_users) module makes it easy to automatically provide a Node Queue for each user of one or more specified roles. This module is being developed for the 2008 Google Summer of Code by Ezra Barnett Gildesgame.

Note: If you wish to restrict access to viewing user node queues, you must do so in the smartqueue_users_user View *as well as* by restricting the 'view on user node queue' and 'view all user node queues' permissions.
